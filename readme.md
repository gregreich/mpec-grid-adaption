**Instructions:**

-   The codes solves the bus engine replacement model of Rust (1987)
    both using a fixed grid and the flexible grid proposed in the paper.

-   As in Section 2.3.3 of the paper, a monte carlo study is conducted
    to estimate the model parameters using both, the flexible and fixed
    grid.

-   The main file to run the codes is ’Main.m’. It reproduces Table 3
    and 5 in the paper depending on the choice of cost function and
    *θ*<sub>2</sub> parameter.

-   Please use Matlab R2017a or a more recent version to run the codes.
